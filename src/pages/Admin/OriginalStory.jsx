        Medical Aid for Ayesha
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        My name is Anjum, and I am a widow raising three young children on my own. 
        My youngest daughter, Ayesha, urgently needs a medical procedure that i simply cannot afford. 
        Since my husband's passing, I have been struggling to cover basic needs, and now the thought of her 
        undergoing surgery without proper support fills me with fear and anxiety. I work multiple small jobs, 
        but the income is never enough. I have tried everything possible to save for her treatment, 
        but hospital bills and medications are far beyond my reach. Seeing her suffer breaks my heart, 
        and I feel helpless knowing that without financial assistance, her health is at serious risk. 
        I am humbly reaching out for your help to provide Ayesha with the medical care she urgently needs. 
        Any contribution, no matter how small, will make a huge difference in her life and give her the 
        chance to recover and grow up healthy. Your support will bring hope and relief to my family.
